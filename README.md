# LapisUI

This is an API for creating item-based UIs in Spigot plugins

## Disclaimer

This API takes great inspiration from Designer. I used to use Designer, but I have no intentions of using Foundation since I have my own
core API in Lapis Core. I decided to build my own simplified version of Designer for my own use. It uses the same structure of 
generics to make a UI from a list of pre-existing objects that can be represented with items on a one by one basis. The main difference is 
the simplicity when compared to Designer. LapisUI is almost identical to use but does have a different look from a playerâ€™s perspective.
Thank you to Kangarko for making Designer and being the inspiration for this project. Check out his projects here on GitHub https://github.com/kangarko
